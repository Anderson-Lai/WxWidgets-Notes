### A repository to store all my notes on wxWidgets

wxWidgets is automatically linked in and compiled against by Visual Studio as wxWidgets was installed with vcpkg<br />
Instructions on how to install wxWidgets with vcpkg (assuming vcpkg is already installed):
  - run vcpkg install wxwidgets
  - vcpkg integrate install
